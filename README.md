# mruby.net

Highly experimental .NET wrappers for [mruby](http://github.com/mruby/mruby). This is just an experiment to see how
feasible such a wrapper is. Don't expect it to work, and please **DO NOT** use it for any production code. You have been
warned. If it totally blows up your computer, "I told you so" is my response. ;)

## License

As for the license, I don't know. Some kind of "be-nice-to-people" license would be cool. Perhaps something that
explicitly forbids its usage in nuclear weapons or other kind of bad stuff. You know, the kind of things that hurt
children and so on. Yes, that's a good point. You may explicitly not use this to make bad things happen to children.
I will poke you with a stick if you break this rule. Promise!

As for the ["axis of evil"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil), which also sometimes not-so-coincidentally
coincides with the nuclear-weapon-interested-nations above, it's probably a good idea to explicitly list them also,
as explicitly prohibited from using this software. That includes, but is not necessarily limited to, North Korea,
Cuba, Syria, and oh, perhaps Iraq and Libya also. (hey, aren't those guys kind of "good" nowadays...?)

The rest of you need not worry. You can feel free to use this under the terms of the very permissive
[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license, or any other license of your chosing (except for perhaps
GPLv3, which is arguably a part of the "axis of evil" also...)

(Yes, 99% of this text is sarcastically intended. If you didn't get it before now, too bad. :)
